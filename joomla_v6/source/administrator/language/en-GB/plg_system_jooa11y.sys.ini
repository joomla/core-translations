PLG_SYSTEM_JOOA11Y="System - Joomla Accessibility Checker"
PLG_SYSTEM_JOOA11Y_XML_DESCRIPTION="The Joomla Accessibility Checker visually highlights common accessibility and usability issues. Geared towards content authors, the plugin identifies errors or warnings and provides guidance on how to fix them. Please be aware that this plugin does not offer an exhaustive analysis of your website, nor does it automatically ensure your website's accessibility. It's important to select a template that is inherently accessible to ensure your site meets accessibility standards."
