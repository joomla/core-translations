COM_CPANEL_MSG_ADDNOSNIFF_BODY="<p>Joomla is now shipped with additional security hardenings in the default htaccess.txt and web.config.txt files. These hardenings disable the so called MIME-type sniffing feature in web browsers. The sniffing leads to specific attack vectors, where scripts in normally harmless file formats (eg images) will be executed, leading to Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerabilities.</p><p>The security team recommends to manually apply the necessary changes to existing .htaccess or web.config files, as those files can not be updated automatically.</p><p><strong>Changes for .htaccess</strong><br>Add the following lines before \"## Mod_rewrite in use.\":</p><pre>&lt;IfModule mod_headers.c&gt;\nHeader always set X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\"\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;</pre><p><strong>Changes for web.config</strong><br>Add the following lines right after \"&lt;/rewrite&gt;\":</p><pre>&lt;httpProtocol&gt;\n  &lt;customHeaders&gt;\n    &lt;add name=\"X-Content-Type-Options\" value=\"nosniff\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/customHeaders&gt;\n&lt;/httpProtocol&gt;</pre>" ; Translators: Don't touch the code part in the message, Starting with ## Mod_rewrite &hellip;

The need for this became clear when a minimum of PHP 5.3.10 was required when Joomla! 3.3 implemented the more secure Bcrypt passwords.</p><p>In the interest of full transparency and to help developers <a href=\"https://developer.joomla.org/about/stats.html\">this data is publicly available.</a> An API and graphs will show the Joomla version, PHP versions and database engines in use.</p><p>If you do not wish to provide the Joomla Project with this information you can disable the plugin called System - Joomla Statistics.</p>"
